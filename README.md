# Machiles-Learning
This repository is created to store any progress of mine developing in Machine Learning.Back to an idea that GitHub stores code or raw data in any size because it is cloud-based platform which means more effective in storing than Google Drive.

PS. I have already put a direct link to Google Colab in Python extension file (.ipynb). It is more project-oriented than "Basic" repository. Use it wise!
