# Machiles-Learning
This repository is created to store any progress of mine developing in Machine Learning. Back to an idea that GitHub stores code or raw data in any size and it give more advantage to me because it is cloud-based platform which means I can store the raw code without worry than Google Drive.

PS. I have already put a direct link to Google Colab in Python extension file (.ipynb). It is more convenient for use because it can give you a direct access right to your own Google Colab. Use it wise!
